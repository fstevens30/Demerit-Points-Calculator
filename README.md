# Demerit Points Calculator

## Description

This is a web application that calculates the demerit points for a speeding ticket. The user enters the speed limit, the speed at which the driver was driving, and if it is a public holiday. The application then calculates the demerit points and displays it to the user. This was made for a lab project in DE101, Introduction to Programming, Ara Institute of Canterbury.

## Technologies

- HTML5 - Creating the web page
